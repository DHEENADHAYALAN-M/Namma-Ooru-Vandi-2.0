You are adding a LOADING / SPLASH SCREEN to an already working project
called "Namma Ooru Vandi".

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change any existing logic.
- Do NOT change routing, GPS, ESP, demo mode, or map behavior.
- Do NOT refactor or move existing code.
- This must be a VISUAL-ONLY addition.

---------------------------------
SPLASH SCREEN REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------

1. DISPLAY BEHAVIOR
- Show the splash screen immediately when the app loads.
- Splash screen should appear BEFORE the main UI.
- Splash screen should disappear automatically after:
  - initial app load OR
  - a short delay (e.g., 1.5–2 seconds).

2. VISUAL DESIGN (MATCH PROVIDED IMAGE)
- Full-screen solid background (deep blue).
- Centered circular logo.
- Logo should contain:
  - A bus illustration
  - A map pin / road concept
- App name text below logo:
  - "Namma Ooru Vandi"
- Clean, modern, mobile-app style.

3. ANIMATION (SUBTLE)
- Add a gentle animation:
  - fade-in
  - or slight scale-in
- Do NOT add heavy animations.

---------------------------------
INTEGRATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
---------------------------------

4. NON-DESTRUCTIVE INTEGRATION
- Do NOT block app logic.
- Do NOT delay API calls.
- Do NOT interfere with routing or state.
- Splash screen must only control VISIBILITY,
  not app initialization.

5. SAFE REMOVAL
- Once app is ready:
  - smoothly fade out the splash screen
  - reveal the existing UI underneath.
- The main app should already be mounted and ready.

---------------------------------
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
---------------------------------

- Implement splash screen as:
  - a top-level UI overlay OR
  - a lightweight loading component.
- Use existing styling system (no new libraries).
- Keep code minimal and readable.

---------------------------------
WHAT NOT TO DO
---------------------------------

- Do NOT create a new page route.
- Do NOT wrap the entire app in complex loaders.
- Do NOT modify existing components.
- Do NOT change performance-critical logic.

---------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
---------------------------------

After implementation:
- App shows a professional splash screen on load.
- Splash screen matches the provided design.
- Splash screen disappears smoothly.
- App behavior remains IDENTICAL afterward.

This is a purely visual enhancement.
