You are building a working MVP called "Namma Ooru Vandi".

The goal is to create a REALISTIC public transport tracking application that looks and behaves like an actual city bus tracking app.

This is a DEMO-READY MVP.
Keep the system simple, stable, and runnable.
Use dummy workflows everywhere, but allow real ESP data for live tracking.

DO NOT use any database.
DO NOT mention programming languages or frameworks in UI or comments.
Use only in-memory or local data.

---------------------------------
SYSTEM ROLES
---------------------------------
1. Passenger
2. Driver
3. Admin

Each role must have a separate dashboard after login.

---------------------------------
LOGIN (DUMMY AUTH)
---------------------------------
- Simple login using in-memory credentials.
- Passenger, Driver, and Admin log in separately.
- After login, redirect to the correct dashboard.
- No external authentication services.

---------------------------------
BUS INITIALIZATION
---------------------------------
- Initialize 5 to 10 buses in memory.
- Each bus must contain:
  - Bus ID
  - Route name
  - Current latitude & longitude
  - Passenger count
  - Crowd level (Low / Medium / High)
  - Status (Running / Stopped)
- Mark one bus as LIVE BUS.
- Other buses must be SIMULATED BUSES.

---------------------------------
REAL-WORLD MAP (MANDATORY)
---------------------------------
- Display a real-world city map.
- Buses must move on actual roads, not random coordinates.
- Each bus must appear as a moving marker.
- Clicking a bus marker must show:
  - Bus ID
  - Route name
  - Crowd level
  - Arrival estimate
- Map must auto-update without refresh.

---------------------------------
ESP INTEGRATION (LIVE BUS)
---------------------------------
- LIVE BUS receives real-time GPS and passenger count from an ESP device.
- Incoming data immediately updates the bus marker on the map.
- If ESP is not connected, fallback to simulated movement.

---------------------------------
SIMULATED BUS MOVEMENT
---------------------------------
- Simulated buses must:
  - Follow predefined real-world routes.
  - Move smoothly along roads.
  - Update passenger count periodically.
  - Change crowd level dynamically.
- Simulation must run continuously.

---------------------------------
CROWD COUNTING
---------------------------------
- Crowd level must be calculated from passenger count.
- Display crowd level using clear visual indicators.
- Updates must reflect instantly on map and dashboards.

---------------------------------
PASSENGER DASHBOARD
---------------------------------
- Show real-time bus locations on the map.
- Show crowd levels before boarding.
- Show estimated arrival time.
- UI should feel like a real transit tracking app.

---------------------------------
DRIVER DASHBOARD
---------------------------------
- Driver is assigned one bus.
- Driver can:
  - View live passenger count
  - See crowd level
  - Start / Stop bus (dummy action)
- Driver actions affect live bus status.

---------------------------------
ADMIN DASHBOARD
---------------------------------
- Admin sees all buses on one real-time map.
- Identify overcrowded buses visually.
- Monitor route-level congestion.

---------------------------------
REAL-TIME BEHAVIOR
---------------------------------
- All updates must be real time.
- No manual refresh.
- Any data change must reflect across all dashboards instantly.

---------------------------------
FAIL-SAFE LOGIC
---------------------------------
- If live ESP data stops:
  - Show status as "Signal Lost"
  - Continue simulation
- App must never crash.

---------------------------------
DEMO REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------
- App must run with a single command.
- Works fully without ESP.
- Enhances experience when ESP is connected.
- Judges must clearly see:
  - Moving buses on real map
  - Live crowd changes
  - Multiple buses running together

---------------------------------
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
---------------------------------
- Clean, readable code
- Clear separation of live vs simulated logic
- Inline comments explaining workflow
- Ready for live demonstration
