You are enhancing the LIVE TRACKING VIEW of an already working project
called "Namma Ooru Vandi".

IMPORTANT:
This task must NOT change or break ANY existing logic.
All current GPS, ESP, demo mode, routes, and data flow MUST remain untouched.

You are ONLY adding a navigation-style visual experience
on top of the existing live tracking.

---------------------------------
ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
---------------------------------

- Do NOT modify existing APIs, data models, or state logic.
- Do NOT change how bus coordinates are produced.
- Do NOT change route definitions.
- Do NOT change UI layout or controls.
- Do NOT refactor files or move code.
- Do NOT remove any existing behavior.

This is a VISUAL + CAMERA enhancement ONLY.

---------------------------------
REQUIRED USER EXPERIENCE
---------------------------------

When the user clicks **"Track Live"**:

1. CAMERA BEHAVIOR
- Smoothly zoom the map in to navigation level.
- Center the map on the selected bus.
- Keep the camera following the bus as it moves.

2. ROUTE VISUALIZATION
- Highlight the full road route clearly.
- Use the existing route polyline data.
- Show the route distinctly from the rest of the map.

3. BUS STOPS (INTERMEDIATE POINTS)
- Display small markers for each intermediate bus stop.
- Stops must be positioned along the route polyline.
- Stops must remain static while the bus moves.

---------------------------------
BUS MOVEMENT (NO JUMPING)
---------------------------------

4. ANIMATED NAVIGATION MOVEMENT
- Keep using the SAME live coordinates already provided.
- Do NOT replace coordinate updates.
- Animate the bus marker smoothly between updates.
- Marker must move incrementally along the route.

5. INTERPOLATION LAYER (ADD-ON ONLY)
- Introduce a visual-only “animated position”.
- Interpolate between:
  - previous live position
  - next live position
- Update animation every frame or second.
- Stop animation once the next position is reached.

---------------------------------
NAVIGATION-LIKE DETAILS
---------------------------------

6. POINTER BEHAVIOR
- Rotate the bus icon to face movement direction.
- Maintain consistent speed between points.
- Do not overshoot or snap.

7. MAP FOLLOW MODE
- While tracking is active:
  - Prevent manual zoom reset.
  - Keep focus locked on the bus.
- Allow user to exit tracking mode manually.

---------------------------------
STRICTLY DO NOT DO
---------------------------------

- Do NOT request external routing APIs.
- Do NOT use Google Directions API.
- Do NOT add new backend endpoints.
- Do NOT change ETA, passenger count, or status logic.
- Do NOT change Trichy region setup.

---------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
---------------------------------

After implementation:
- Clicking "Track Live" feels like Google Maps navigation.
- Map zooms in automatically.
- Route is clearly visible.
- Bus stops are visible along the route.
- Bus moves smoothly along the road.
- Camera follows the bus continuously.
- NO teleporting or jumping.
- ALL existing logic remains unchanged.

This is a purely visual navigation enhancement.
