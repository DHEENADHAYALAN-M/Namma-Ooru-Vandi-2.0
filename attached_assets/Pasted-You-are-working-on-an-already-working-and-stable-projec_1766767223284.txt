You are working on an already working and stable project
called "Namma Ooru Vandi".

IMPORTANT:
This task must NOT change, replace, or break ANY existing logic.
All current behavior must remain exactly the same.

You are ONLY allowed to ADD a smooth animation layer
on top of the existing live tracking logic.

---------------------------------
ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
---------------------------------

- Do NOT modify existing APIs, routes, or data structures.
- Do NOT change GPS, ESP, demo mode, or location priority logic.
- Do NOT remove or rewrite current movement code.
- Do NOT change UI layout, buttons, or flows.
- Do NOT refactor files or reorganize code.

If something already works, leave it untouched.

---------------------------------
PROBLEM TO SOLVE (ADD-ON ONLY)
---------------------------------

Current behavior:
- When "Track Live" is clicked, bus positions update correctly.
- However, the marker jumps instantly between points.

Required improvement:
- Keep the SAME position updates.
- ADD smooth, navigation-style animation between updates.
- The bus should glide along roads instead of teleporting.

---------------------------------
HOW TO IMPLEMENT (SAFE ADDITION)
---------------------------------

1. KEEP EXISTING POSITION SOURCE
- Continue using the current coordinates exactly as they are.
- Do NOT change how or when new coordinates arrive.

2. ADD ANIMATION LAYER
- Introduce an intermediate “display position” for the bus marker.
- When a new coordinate arrives:
  - Do NOT jump the marker.
  - Gradually animate from the old position to the new position.

3. INTERPOLATION ONLY
- Use interpolation between:
  - previousPosition
  - nextPosition
- Move the marker a small step every animation frame or second.
- Stop animation once the next position is reached.

4. ROUTE & MAP SAFETY
- Do NOT change route polylines.
- Do NOT request new routing data.
- Only animate the marker along the already-visible road path.

---------------------------------
MAP & UI BEHAVIOR
---------------------------------

- Map centering behavior must remain unchanged.
- “Track Live” button behavior must remain unchanged.
- Crowd level, ETA, and status updates must continue working.
- Bus icon, colors, and labels must remain unchanged.

---------------------------------
TIMING
---------------------------------

- Animation must feel continuous and smooth.
- Speed must feel like a real city bus.
- Do NOT make the bus faster than the actual update rate.

---------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
---------------------------------

After this change:
- Bus still receives the same coordinates as before.
- No logic is replaced or removed.
- Marker no longer jumps.
- Marker moves smoothly like real navigation apps.
- Everything else behaves IDENTICALLY.

This is a visual enhancement ONLY.
No functional changes are allowed.
